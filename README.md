# Kaggle-Titanic
These are notebooks of code I wrote for the Kaggle Titanic competition, focused on classification. By the end of this work, I got a test set accuracy of 0.779, putting me in 2835th place (although many people above me in the leaderboard have the same test accuracy).
The first 3 notebooks, titanic_survival_competition through titanic_survival_competition_3, were made in early September 2023 and demonstrate some very early feature analysis I did. Between working on these and making the feature_importance notebooks, I made many more attempts at the competition, but the code is just trying different Sci-Kit Learn models with random search, so I don't think they're worthwhile to include. The feature_importance notebooks were made in late September 2023 and show further attempts at feature analysis (e.g. using Pearson's correlation coefficient), along with some feature engineering.
At the time of writing this, 9/29/23, I'm under the impression that the dataset may not have *enough* dimensionality. When I get the chance, I'm going to see how SVMs with kernels perform on this dataset.
